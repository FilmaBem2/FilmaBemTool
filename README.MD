# Filma Bem Tool
This tool was made to install software after a fresh windows install. It uses Chocolatey as backend. if you don’t have chocolatey installed it will install Chocolatey and sudo to install the software you want. Filma Bem Tool uses qt for the gui.

# First Run
if it’s the first run or chocolatey is not installed this tool will relaunch as root to install it and then install sudo to elevate privileges to install programs. I recommend you to close the tool and re-open it after chocolatey is installed. To avoid some issues this tool will only run as admin if it needs to install chocolatey. All other software instalations will use sudo to elevate privileges.

# Top Menu
In the top menu you have the ‘Software’ tab with 2 options to troubleshoot and an option to upgrade all software installed by this tool or directlly by chocolatey. In the same menu you have the ‘Help’ tab with 2 options. One of them is some information about the tool and the other option is to donate to my paypal.
